# Prework-study-guide
Study guide for UNCC Bootcamp rework
## Desciption

The coding bootcamp starts with a prework section that helps students prepare for the bootcam. The topics introduced in the prework are foundational for the material that is eventually covered in bootcamp. This project, the prework-study-guide, is a study guide for new coding bootcamp students to help them organize and start studying the topics introduced in the prework. The prework-study-guide will randomly pick a topic for the student to study first to help get things started. This project has taught me core skills in developing.
